I implemented a Na√Øve Bayesian classifier based on the pseudocode given in the assignment. The learner
looks at the training data and keeps a count of how many times any one feature appears positive in either
the normal or anomalous class. Then after it learns what features are generally positive for a given class
it computes the how likely a given test instance is normal and how likely it's anomalous. The classifier
then picks the one with the higher probability of being correct. At the end the program checks the
computed classifications against the true classes of the test instances and displays statistics of how
many are correctly classified.

Below are my results for each data set provided.

orig 142/187 (0.76) 10/15 (0.67) 132/172 (0.77)
itg 145/187 (0.78) 15/15 (1.0) 130/172 (0.76)
resplit 78/90 (0.87) 17/19 (0.89) 61/71 (0.86)
resplit-itg 63/90 (0.7) 17/19 (0.89) 46/71 (0.65)

My testing was done on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) under Ubuntu using a Intel i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz.
